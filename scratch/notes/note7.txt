Multiple levels of obfuscation.
==================================

Applies primarily when insert transforms are involved.
Inserting a new line results in a new program P_1 altogether, which can again be optimized as if it were P.

def foo:
    x1. print x
    p = a.stmnt + b
    y1. print y
sites: 
L1, p , a, stmnt, b, L2
def foo1:
    x1. L1
    f1 = f2.f3 + f4
    x2 . L2
    print f5
    x3 . L3
def foo':
    P1
    f1 = f2.f3 + f4
    P2
    print(f5)
    P3
